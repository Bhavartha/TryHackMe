## Introduction to Port Scanning

<br/>

### Q1) What networking constructs are used to direct traffic to the right application on a server?
**Answer: `ports`**

**Explaination:** \
When a computer runs a network service, it opens a networking construct called a “port” to receive the connection.  Ports are necessary for making multiple network requests or having multiple services available. For example, when you load several webpages at once in a web browser, the program must have some way of determining which tab is loading which web page. This is done by establishing connections to the remote webservers using different ports on your local machine.

### Q2) How many of these are available on any network-enabled computer?

**Answer: `65535`**

**Explaination:** \
Every computer has a total of 65535 available ports
