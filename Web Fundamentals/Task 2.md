## How do we load websites? 

<br/>

### Q1) What request verb is used to retrieve page content?
**Answer: `GET`**

**Explaination:** \
Once the browser knows the server's IP address, it can ask the server for the web page.\
This is done with a HTTP GET request. GET is an example of a HTTP verb, which are the different types of request (More on these later).\
The server will respond to the GET request with the web page content. If the web page is loading extra resources, like JavaScript, images, or CSS files, those will be retrieved in separate GET requests.
